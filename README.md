### Projects

#### Earnings or environment: an exploration of the relationship between wellbeing, access to nature and earnings across London's boroughs 
##### <i>Data visualisation using Geopandas and Matplotlib</i>
In this project, I explore and visualise the relationship between wellbeing, greenspace and earnings across different parts of London. I ask:

- Is there a link, for Londoners, between wellbeing and access to nature?
- Does being a high earner feature in the relationship between these variables?

I draw on two datasets, from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), which record various wellbeing and wealth metrics across each of London's boroughs. I link these with Ordnance Survey data charting the extent of green and blue spaces - the cityâ€™s parks, gardens, trees, green spaces, rivers and wetlands, and features such as green roofs.

#### Record temperatures: is London's weather is becoming more volatile?
##### <i>Data visualisation using Matplotlib</i>
This data visualisation explores how London's weather is changing. I show the many instances in 2024 when daily minima and maxima air temperature exceeded the lowest and highest temperatures for that day recorded in the preceding decade.

#### Neural network from scratch
This project creates a neural network from scratch using Numpy. The purpose was to help me fully understand the mathematics of neural networks and how to translate it into code without recourse to ML libraries. (A subsequent project will construct a more elaborate convolutional neural network using Pytorch.)
