### Projects

#### Earnings or environment: an exploration of the relationship between wellbeing, access to nature and earnings across London's boroughs
In this project, I explore and visualise the relationship between wellbeing, greenspace and earnings across different parts of London. I ask:

- Is there a link, for Londoners, between wellbeing and access to nature?
- Does being a high earner feature in the relationship between these variables?

I draw on two datasets, from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), which record various wellbeing and wealth metrics across each of London's boroughs. I link these with Ordnance Survey data charting the extent of green and blue spaces - the city’s parks, gardens, trees, green spaces, rivers and wetlands, and features such as green roofs.
